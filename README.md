# Development and Process Optimization of a High-Density Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) Module Prototype

This repository documents a personal capstone project designed to demonstrate my capabilities in advanced semiconductor packaging, specifically targeting the challenges of Co-Packaged Optics (CPO). The project leverages my industrial experience in 2.5D TSV technology and materials analysis.

### üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective was to design, fabricate, and validate a prototype CPO module. This project aimed to address two critical challenges in CPO:
1.  **Thermal Management:** Mitigating the heat generated by the high-power switch ASIC and optical engines in close proximity.
2.  **High-Frequency Signal Integrity:** Ensuring low-loss signal transmission from the electrical IC (EIC) to the photonic IC (PIC) via a silicon interposer.

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The project was executed in four main phases:

**1. Design & Simulation:**
*   Designed a silicon interposer with integrated TSVs using **AutoCAD**. The design included micro-bumps for flip-chip bonding of the EIC and PIC.
*   Conducted thermal and signal integrity simulations using **COMSOL Multiphysics** and **Ansys HFSS**. This helped optimize the TSV geometry and material stack-up to minimize thermal crosstalk and high-frequency insertion loss.

**2. Interposer Fabrication:**
*   Leveraged my experience with the **Bosch process** for high-aspect-ratio Deep Si Etching to create the TSVs.
*   Deposited a SiO‚ÇÇ/Si‚ÇÉN‚ÇÑ composite insulation layer using **PECVD**, optimizing the process to ensure uniform sidewall coverage, achieving a 30% improvement in thickness uniformity compared to standard processes.
*   Completed metallization (Cu seed/plating) and CMP for wafer planarization.

**3. Hybrid Assembly:**
*   Performed high-precision flip-chip bonding to mount a dummy EIC and a PIC onto the silicon interposer.
*   Managed the delicate process of coupling a fiber array to the edge of the PIC, a critical step for optical I/O.

**4. Characterization & Validation:**
*   Used **SEM/EDS** to inspect the cross-section of TSVs and solder bump interfaces, verifying structural integrity and identifying any process-induced defects.
*   Conducted electrical tests to measure signal integrity (S-parameters) and generated eye diagrams for a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) at 56 Gbps.
*   Performed optical tests to measure the insertion loss and crosstalk of the optical pathways.

### üìà Key Results & Highlights

*   **Improved Thermal Performance:** The optimized design, validated by simulation and testing, demonstrated a **15% reduction in thermal resistance** compared to conventional packaging solutions, ensuring the junction temperature of the EIC remained within the safe operating margin.
*   **Excellent Signal Integrity:** Achieved a clean, open eye diagram at **56 Gbps/channel**, with insertion loss below -5 dB up to 28 GHz, demonstrating the viability of the TSV-based interposer for high-speed communication.
*   **Low Optical Coupling Loss:** The fiber array coupling process was refined to achieve an average insertion loss of **less than 2.0 dB per channel**.
*   **High Process Yield:** By applying knowledge from my previous industrial projects, the overall fabrication and assembly process achieved a high first-pass yield, demonstrating a strong capability for process control and problem-solving.
